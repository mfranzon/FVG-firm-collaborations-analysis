# FVG Firm collaborations network analysis

This work briefly explore the network of collaboration between companies in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region of Italy. The first part introduces the dataset and shows companies distribution in the region with respect to different variables such as company type and location. 

Then matrices of collaboration between categories of companies are shown, one for each province of the dataset, and then used to choose interesting subsets of the network. The two subgraphs of collaboration chosen show the interaction between manufacturing companies and construction companies in Trieste province, and the interaction between manufacturing companies and retail companies in Udine province. 

These subgraphs are investigated both in their indirected and directed form in order to find firm communities. Finally, ERG modeling is used to analyze them in order to find good correlations between dataset variables and network topology.
